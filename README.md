# An Empirical Study of The Power of Contrast in Feature Learning

*This project was done as part of NUS graduate course CS5339. The repo contains the code that can be used to replicate the results, as well as a report to document our observations.*

**Please use `run_experiments.py` to run your own experiments and `visualize_results.py` to create graphs. We highly recommend adapting the format of `run_experiments.py` but writing your own code if you want to extend our experiments.**
